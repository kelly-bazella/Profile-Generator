# Profile-Generator
This application is used to quickly gather data on a person and present it in a readable and easily accessible format. 

The user will first input their favorite color and then their, or someone elses, GitHub username. The application will then take that user name, make an axios call to the GitHub API to gather their information. It will then create in html file, convert it to PDF and it will be presented to the user.
